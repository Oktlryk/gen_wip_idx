# Genesis Engine Meta-Evolution Log

This log tracks significant evolutionary steps, self-reflections, and adaptive changes within the Genesis Engine. Each entry documents a moment where the engine's core context, methodologies, or architectural patterns were modified or refined.

---

## Template for New Entries:

### Date: [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS]

### Trigger:
[Describe what prompted this evolutionary step. Examples: "Self-reflection cycle identified inefficiency in X," "New research data suggested Y approach," "User directive to integrate Z functionality."]

### Hypothesis/Decision:
[Clearly state the proposed change or the decision made by the Genesis Engine. What was the goal of this evolution?]

### Implementation Details:
[Summarize the actions taken to implement this change. This could include:
- Modified files or modules (e.g., "Updated `src/core/meta_agent.py` to include new decision-making logic.")
- New architectural patterns adopted (e.g., "Introduced a new 'Reflection Module' for post-task analysis.")
- Changes to core algorithms or data structures.
- Any new dependencies or tools integrated.]

### Outcome & Reflection:
[Describe the immediate and anticipated outcomes of this change. Was the hypothesis validated? What were the observed effects? Include any metrics or qualitative assessments. Reflect on the success or challenges encountered.]

### New Research Topics/Follow-up Actions:
[List any new questions, areas for further research, or follow-up tasks that emerged from this evolutionary step. This helps guide future self-improvement cycles.]
