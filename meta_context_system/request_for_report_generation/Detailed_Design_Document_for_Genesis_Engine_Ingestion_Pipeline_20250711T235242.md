# Report Request: Detailed Design Document for Genesis Engine Ingestion Pipeline

## Justification
The Genesis Engine requires comprehensive documentation of its ingestion pipeline's design, including data flow, error handling, and integration points.

## Key Questions
- What are the detailed architectural components of the ingestion pipeline?
- How does the pipeline handle various document formats and extract metadata?
- What are the error handling and retry mechanisms in place?
- How does the ingestion pipeline integrate with the knowledge base and other Genesis Engine components?

## Desired Format
Technical Report

## Priority Level
Critical

## Suggested Sources
- Internal design discussions
- Existing code documentation
- Data ingestion best practices
