    "overview": "## High-Level Architectural Plan: Simple Todo App\n\n### Overview\n\nThe Simple Todo App will be a basic web application designed to help individuals manage their personal tasks. It will feature a user-friendly frontend interacting with a robust backend API. The application will allow users to add new todo items, view a list of existing todos, and mark tasks as complete. The architecture emphasizes simplicity, maintainability, and extensibility, utilizing Python with FastAPI for the backend and standard web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) for the frontend.\n\n### Key Components\n\n1.  **Frontend (Client-Side):**\n    *   **Technologies:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript.\n    *   **Functionality:** Provides the user interface for displaying todo items, input forms for adding new todos, and controls for marking tasks as complete. It will consume data from and send requests to the Backend API.\n    *   **Deployment:** Static files served by a web server (e.g., Nginx, Apache) or directly by the backend server.\n\n2.  **Backend (Server-Side):**\n    *   **Technology:** Python with FastAPI.\n    *   **Functionality:**\n        *   Exposes RESTful API endpoints for todo management.\n        *   Handles business logic related to todo items (e.g., validation, status updates).\n        *   Interacts with the database to persist and retrieve todo data.\n        *   **Web Server Gateway Interface (WSGI) / Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface (ASGI) Server:** Uvicorn (recommended for FastAPI) to serve the application.\n\n3.  **Database:**\n    *   **Technology:** SQLite (for development and simplicity) or PostgreSQL (for production readiness and scalability).\n    *   **Functionality:** Stores all todo item data.\n    *   **Interaction:** Accessed by the Backend using an Object-Relational Mapper (ORM) like SQLAlchemy or directly via a database driver.\n\n### Data Models\n\nA single core data model will represent a todo item.\n\n**`Todo` Model:**\n\n| Field          | Type        | Description                                  | Constraints       |\n| :------------- | :---------- | :------------------------------------------- | :---------------- |\n| `id`           | Integer     | Unique identifier for the todo item          | Primary Key, Auto-increment |\n| `title`        | String      | A brief description of the todo              | Not Null, Max Length (e.g., 255) |\n| `description`  | String      | Optional longer description                  | Nullable          |\n| `is_completed` | Boolean     | Status of the todo (true if complete)        | Default: `False`  |\n| `created_at`   | Datetime    | Timestamp when the todo was created          | Auto-generated    |\n| `updated_at`   | Datetime    | Timestamp of the last update                 | Auto-updated      |\n\n### API Endpoints\n\nThe Backend will expose the following RESTful API endpoints, typically prefixed with `/api` or `/todos`. Let's use `/todos` for simplicity.\n\n1.  **Add a new Todo Item:**\n    *   **Endpoint:** `POST /todos/`\n    *   **Description:** Creates a new todo item.\n    *   **Request Body:**\n        ```json\n        {\n          \"title\": \"Buy groceries\",\n          \"description\": \"Milk, eggs, bread\"\n        }\n        ```\n    *   **Response:** `201 Created` with the newly created todo item (including `id`, `is_completed`, `created_at`, `updated_at`).\n\n2.  **List All Todo Items:**\n    *   **Endpoint:** `GET /todos/`\n    *   **Description:** Retrieves a list of all todo items.\n    *   **Response:** `200 OK` with an array of todo items.\n        ```json\n        [\n          {\n            \"id\": 1,\n            \"title\": \"Buy groceries\",\n            \"description\": \"Milk, eggs, bread\",\n            \"is_completed\": false,\n            \"created_at\": \"2023-10-27T10:00:00Z\",\n            \"updated_at\": \"2023-10-27T10:00:00Z\"\n          },\n          // ... more todo items\n        ]\n        ```\n\n3.  **Mark a Todo Item as Complete (or Update):**\n    *   **Endpoint:** `PATCH /todos/{todo_id}`\n    *   **Description:** Updates the status (or any other field) of a specific todo item.\n    *   **Request Body (to mark complete):**\n        ```json\n        {\n          \"is_completed\": true\n        }\n        ```\n    *   **Response:** `200 OK` with the updated todo item.\n\n**(Optional/Future Endpoints for completeness):**\n\n*   **Get a Single Todo Item:** `GET /todos/{todo_id}`\n*   **Delete a Todo Item:** `DELETE /todos/{todo_id}`\n\n### Security Considerations\n\nFor a \"simple\" app, elaborate security might be overkill, but fundamental practices are essential:\n\n1.  **Input Validation:** All incoming data from the frontend to the FastAPI backend must be validated (FastAPI's Pydantic models automatically handle this effectively) to prevent common vulnerabilities like SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).\n2.  **HTTPS:** All communication between the frontend and backend should be encrypted using HTTPS to protect data in transit.\n3.  **CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing):** If the frontend and backend are hosted on different domains/ports, proper CORS headers must be configured in FastAPI to allow legitimate cross-origin requests and block malicious ones.\n4.  **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling to prevent sensitive information from being exposed in error messages to the client.\n5.  **No Direct Database Access:** The frontend should never directly access the database; all interactions must go through the FastAPI backend.\n6.  **Authentication/Authorization:** While not explicitly required for a *single-user personal* todo app, if multiple users were to be introduced, a robust authentication (e.g., JWT, OAuth2) and authorization system would be paramount.\n\n### Scalability Considerations\n\nWhile designed for simplicity, the chosen technologies provide a good foundation for future scaling:\n\n1.  **Stateless Backend:** The FastAPI application will be designed to be stateless, meaning no user-specific session data is stored directly on the server. This allows for easy horizontal scaling.\n2.  **Horizontal Scaling:** Multiple instances of the FastAPI application can be deployed behind a load balancer (e.g., Nginx, cloud load balancer) to distribute incoming traffic and handle increased user load.\n3.  **Database Scalability:**\n    *   **SQLite:** Suitable for development and very small-scale personal use.\n    *   **PostgreSQL:** For production, PostgreSQL offers robust features, good performance, and various scaling options (read replicas, sharding) if the application grows.\n4.  **Asynchronous Operations:** FastAPI's asynchronous nature (based on ASGI) allows it to handle many concurrent connections efficiently, improving performance under load.\n5.  **Containerization:** Packaging the FastAPI application in Docker containers will simplify deployment, ensure environment consistency, and facilitate orchestration with tools like Kubernetes for large-scale deployments.\n6.  **Caching:** For a simple todo app, caching is unlikely to be necessary. However, for future growth with high read volumes, a caching layer (e.g., Redis) could be introduced to reduce database load.",
