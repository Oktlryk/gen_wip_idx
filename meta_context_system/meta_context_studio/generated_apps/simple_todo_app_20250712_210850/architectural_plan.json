    "overview": "## High-Level Architectural Plan: Simple Todo App\n\n### 1. Brief Overview\n\nThis architectural plan outlines a standard client-server web application for managing personal todo items. The application will consist of a user-friendly frontend interacting with a robust backend API. Data persistence will be handled by a relational database. Adhering to the \"Simple Todo App\" requirements, the design emphasizes clarity, maintainability, and foundational best practices.\n\nWhile this specific application is straightforward, its design principles align with how an \"Architect Agent\" (as described in Context [4] and [5]) would approach devising technical specifications and system architecture, focusing on modularity and clear interfaces for subsequent development phases.\n\n### 2. Key Components\n\n1.  **Frontend (Web UI)**\n    *   **Technology**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript.\n    *   **Description**: The user interface layer, running in the user's web browser. It will be responsible for rendering the list of todos, providing input forms for adding new todos, and controls for marking todos as complete. It will communicate with the Backend API using standard HTTP requests.\n\n2.  **Backend API (FastAPI)**\n    *   **Technology**: Python, FastAPI.\n    *   **Description**: The core application logic layer. This component will expose RESTful API endpoints for managing todo items. It will handle:\n        *   Receiving requests from the Frontend.\n        *   Validating input data.\n        *   Interacting with the Database for data persistence.\n        *   Implementing business logic (e.g., marking a todo as complete).\n        *   Returning appropriate responses to the Frontend.\n\n3.  **Database**\n    *   **Technology**: PostgreSQL (recommended for production, SQLite for local development).\n    *   **Description**: A relational database used for persistent storage of todo items. It will store all the necessary information about each todo, such as its title, status, and timestamps.\n\n### 3. Data Models\n\nThe primary data entity is a `TodoItem`.\n\n*   **`TodoItem` Model:**\n    *   `id`: Unique identifier (e.g., UUID or auto-incrementing integer). Primary Key.\n    *   `title`: String, required. The main description of the todo item.\n    *   `description`: String, optional. More detailed notes for the todo item.\n    *   `completed`: Boolean, default `false`. Indicates whether the todo item is completed.\n    *   `created_at`: Datetime, automatically set on creation.\n    *   `updated_at`: Datetime, automatically updated on modification.\n\n### 4. API Endpoints\n\nThe Backend API will expose the following RESTful endpoints:\n\n*   **`GET /todos`**\n    *   **Description**: Retrieve a list of all todo items.\n    *   **Response**: `200 OK` with an array of `TodoItem` objects.\n\n*   **`POST /todos`**\n    *   **Description**: Create a new todo item.\n    *   **Request Body**: JSON object containing at least `title` (e.g., `{\"title\": \"Buy groceries\", \"description\": \"Milk, eggs, bread\"}`).\n    *   **Response**: `201 Created` with the newly created `TodoItem` object.\n\n*   **`PUT /todos/{todo_id}/complete`**\n    *   **Description**: Mark a specific todo item as complete. This is a specific action-oriented endpoint. Alternatively, a `PATCH /todos/{todo_id}` could be used for general updates.\n    *   **Path Parameter**: `todo_id` (the ID of the todo item).\n    *   **Response**: `200 OK` with the updated `TodoItem` object. `404 Not Found` if `todo_id` does not exist.\n\n*   **`DELETE /todos/{todo_id}`**\n    *   **Description**: Delete a specific todo item.\n    *   **Path Parameter**: `todo_id` (the ID of the todo item).\n    *   **Response**: `204 No Content` on successful deletion. `404 Not Found` if `todo_id` does not exist.\n\n### 5. Security Considerations\n\nFor a simple personal todo app, advanced security might be overkill, but fundamental practices are essential:\n\n*   **Input Validation**: All incoming data to the FastAPI backend must be rigorously validated to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection) and ensure data integrity. FastAPI's Pydantic models naturally assist with this.\n*   **CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)**: Configure FastAPI to allow requests only from the trusted frontend origin to prevent cross-site request forgery (CSRF) for simple cases where the frontend is served from a different domain/port.\n*   **HTTPS/SSL**: All communication between the Frontend and Backend should be encrypted using HTTPS to protect data in transit.\n*   **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling to avoid revealing sensitive system information in error messages.\n*   **Authentication/Authorization**: Not strictly required for a single-user personal app, but if multiple users were introduced, a robust authentication (e.g., JWT, OAuth2) and authorization system would be critical to ensure users can only access/modify their own todos.\n\n### 6. Scalability Considerations\n\nWhile a \"Simple Todo App\" might not require immediate high scalability, designing with future growth in mind is prudent:\n\n*   **Stateless API**: FastAPI applications are inherently stateless, meaning each request is independent. This allows for easy horizontal scaling by running multiple instances of the API.\n*   **Database Scalability**:\n    *   Start with a robust relational database like PostgreSQL.\n    *   For read-heavy loads, consider read replicas.\n    *   For extremely high write loads or data volume, explore sharding or partitioning strategies.\n*   **Load Balancing**: Deploying the FastAPI application behind a load balancer (e.g., Nginx, AWS ELB) will distribute incoming traffic across multiple API instances, improving performance and availability.\n*   **Containerization**: Using Docker to containerize the FastAPI application simplifies deployment, ensures environment consistency, and facilitates orchestration with tools like Kubernetes for automated scaling and management.\n*   **Caching**: For a simple todo app, caching might not be necessary. However, for more complex features or high read volumes, implementing caching (e.g., Redis) for frequently accessed data could reduce database load.",
