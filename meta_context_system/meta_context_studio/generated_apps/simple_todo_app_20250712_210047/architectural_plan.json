    "overview": "## High-Level Architectural Plan: Simple Todo App\n\n### Overview\n\nThis architectural plan outlines a basic web application for managing personal todo items. It follows a classic client-server architecture, where a frontend (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) interacts with a backend API built with Python's FastAPI. Data will be persisted in a simple database. The focus is on simplicity, clarity, and meeting the core requirements: adding, listing, and marking todos as complete.\n\n### Key Components\n\n1.  **Frontend (Client-Side Application):**\n    *   **Technologies:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript.\n    *   **Functionality:**\n        *   Displays the list of todo items.\n        *   Provides an input form to add new todos.\n        *   Allows users to interact with existing todos (e.g., mark as complete).\n        *   Makes asynchronous API calls to the backend using JavaScript (e.g., `fetch` API).\n    *   **Deployment:** Static files served by a web server (e.g., Nginx, Apache) or a simple Python static file server for development.\n\n2.  **Backend (API Server):**\n    *   **Technologies:** Python, FastAPI.\n    *   **Functionality:**\n        *   Defines and exposes RESTful API endpoints for todo management.\n        *   Handles incoming HTTP requests from the frontend.\n        *   Performs data validation and business logic.\n        *   Interacts with the database to store and retrieve todo items.\n        *   Returns JSON responses to the frontend.\n    *   **Deployment:** Runs as a long-running process, typically behind a WSGI server (e.g., Uvicorn) and potentially a reverse proxy.\n\n3.  **Database:**\n    *   **Technology:** SQLite (for simplicity and development), easily switchable to PostgreSQL or MySQL for production environments.\n    *   **Functionality:** Stores the todo item data.\n\n### Data Models\n\nA single core data model is required: `Todo`.\n\n**Todo Model:**\n\n*   **`id`**: Unique identifier for the todo item (Integer, Primary Key, Auto-increment).\n*   **`title`**: The description/content of the todo item (String, Not Null).\n*   **`completed`**: A boolean flag indicating whether the todo item is completed (Boolean, Default: `False`).\n\n*Representation in FastAPI (using Pydantic):*\n\n```python\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel\n\nclass TodoBase(BaseModel):\n    title: str\n\nclass TodoCreate(TodoBase):\n    pass # No extra fields for creation, just title\n\nclass Todo(TodoBase):\n    id: int\n    completed: bool = False\n\n    class Config:\n        orm_mode = True # For SQLAlchemy integration if used\n```\n\n### API Endpoints\n\nThe backend FastAPI application will expose the following RESTful API endpoints:\n\n1.  **Add a new Todo:**\n    *   **Method:** `POST`\n    *   **Path:** `/todos`\n    *   **Request Body:** `{\"title\": \"string\"}` (e.g., `{\"title\": \"Buy groceries\"}`)\n    *   **Response:** `201 Created` with the newly created `Todo` object (including `id` and `completed` status).\n    *   **Description:** Creates a new todo item in the database.\n\n2.  **List all Todos:**\n    *   **Method:** `GET`\n    *   **Path:** `/todos`\n    *   **Request Parameters:** None (or optional query params for filtering/pagination if needed in the future).\n    *   **Response:** `200 OK` with a JSON array of `Todo` objects.\n    *   **Description:** Retrieves all todo items stored in the database.\n\n3.  **Mark a Todo as Complete:**\n    *   **Method:** `PUT`\n    *   **Path:** `/todos/{todo_id}/complete`\n    *   **Path Parameter:** `todo_id` (Integer) - The ID of the todo item to mark as complete.\n    *   **Request Body:** None (or optional `{\"completed\": true}` for a more generic update endpoint).\n    *   **Response:** `200 OK` with the updated `Todo` object. `404 Not Found` if `todo_id` does not exist.\n    *   **Description:** Updates the `completed` status of a specific todo item to `True`.\n\n### Security Considerations\n\nFor a *simple* personal todo app, advanced security (like user authentication/authorization) is typically out of scope. However, basic best practices should still be followed:\n\n*   **Input Validation:** FastAPI's Pydantic models automatically provide robust input validation, preventing common injection attacks and ensuring data integrity.\n*   **CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing):** If the frontend and backend are hosted on different domains/ports, CORS must be properly configured in the FastAPI application to allow the frontend to make requests.\n*   **HTTPS:** In a production environment, always deploy with HTTPS to encrypt data in transit.\n*   **Error Handling:** Implement graceful error handling to avoid exposing sensitive server details in error messages.\n*   **Dependency Security:** Keep Python packages and their dependencies updated to patch known vulnerabilities.\n\n### Scalability Considerations\n\nFor a \"Simple Todo App\" targeting \"Individuals managing personal tasks,\" high scalability is not a primary concern initially. However, the chosen technologies provide a good foundation:\n\n*   **FastAPI Performance:** FastAPI is built on Starlette and Uvicorn, making it very performant and suitable for handling a decent load due to its asynchronous nature.\n*   **Stateless Backend:** The API endpoints are stateless, meaning any backend instance can handle any request. This facilitates horizontal scaling by simply running multiple FastAPI instances behind a load balancer.\n*   **Database Scaling:**\n    *   **SQLite:** Excellent for development and very small-scale deployments. Not suitable for concurrent writes or high-volume production.\n    *   **PostgreSQL/MySQL:** For increased scale, moving to a robust relational database like PostgreSQL is straightforward. These databases can be scaled vertically (more powerful server) or horizontally (read replicas, sharding) as needed.\n*   **Frontend:** The frontend is composed of static files, which can be easily cached and served efficiently by CDNs, ensuring high availability and low latency globally.",
