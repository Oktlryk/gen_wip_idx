Phase 2: Topics for Gemini Deep Research (Guiding Evolution)


  These topics are designed to push the boundaries of the Genesis Engine's self-evolution capabilities. They
   focus on areas where the current system has placeholders or could significantly benefit from advanced
  AI/software engineering methodologies.


   1. Advanced Information Extraction (IE) & Knowledge Graph Population:
       * Challenge: Current IE is basic. How to extract complex, nested workflows, implicit policies, and
         nuanced architectural decisions from highly unstructured text (e.g., meeting transcripts, informal
         design docs, code comments)?
       * Research Focus:
           * Event-based IE: Extracting sequences of actions, conditions, and outcomes to formalize complex
             processes.
           * Argument Mining: Identifying and extracting arguments, justifications, and trade-offs from design
              discussions.
           * Multi-modal IE: Integrating information from diagrams, screenshots, and code snippets alongside
             text.
           * Weak Supervision/Self-Supervised IE: Techniques for training IE models with minimal human
             labeling.


   2. Autonomous Ontology Learning and Evolution:
       * Challenge: Our current ontologies are manually defined. How can the system automatically discover,
         refine, and extend its own conceptual models of software engineering domains?
       * Research Focus:
           * Ontology Induction: Automatically generating ontologies from text corpora and codebases.
           * Ontology Alignment/Merging: Reconciling and integrating knowledge from disparate sources into a
             coherent ontology.
           * Dynamic Ontology Updates: Mechanisms for the system to update its ontology in real-time as new
             knowledge is acquired.
           * Knowledge Graph Completion: Inferring missing relationships and entities within the KG.


   3. Meta-Learning for Prompt Engineering & Reasoning:
       * Challenge: Our prompts are static templates. How can the system learn to generate better prompts for
         its own LLM agents, and how can it improve its internal reasoning processes (CoT, ToT, GoT)?
       * Research Focus:
           * Automated Prompt Optimization: Using reinforcement learning or evolutionary algorithms to
             discover optimal prompt structures and phrasing for specific tasks.
           * Self-Refinement of Reasoning Chains: Enabling the LLM to reflect on its own reasoning steps,
             identify flaws, and correct them.
           * Contextual Prompt Generation: Dynamically generating prompts that are highly tailored to the
             specific context, agent, and sub-task.
           * LLM-as-a-Judge for Prompt Quality: Using one LLM to evaluate the effectiveness of prompts
             generated by another.


   4. Adaptive Agent Orchestration & Conflict Resolution:
       * Challenge: Our agent orchestration is sequential. How can the MetaAgent dynamically adapt workflows,
         handle conflicts between agents, and learn optimal collaboration strategies?
       * Research Focus:
           * Dynamic Workflow Generation: Beyond fixed plans, generating and adapting workflows on the fly
             based on real-time feedback and environmental changes.
           * Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning: Training agents to collaborate and compete effectively to
             achieve complex goals.
           * Conflict Detection and Resolution: Mechanisms for the MetaAgent to identify conflicting outputs
             or decisions from sub-agents and resolve them autonomously.
           * Agent Specialization & Generalization: How agents can learn when to specialize in a task versus
             when to generalize their knowledge.


   5. Automated Policy Inference and Enforcement:
       * Challenge: Policies are manually written. How can the system automatically infer best practices and
         security policies from observed successful projects and enforce them during code generation?
       * Research Focus:
           * Policy Mining: Extracting implicit rules and constraints from code, documentation, and historical
              data.
           * Formal Verification of Policies: Ensuring that inferred policies are consistent and do not lead
             to unintended consequences.
           * Runtime Policy Enforcement: Integrating policy checks directly into the code generation and
             integration phases.


   6. Continuous Evaluation and Self-Correction:
       * Challenge: Evaluation is currently a separate step. How can the system continuously monitor its own
         performance and autonomously initiate self-correction loops?
       * Research Focus:
           * Real-time Performance Monitoring: Developing metrics and feedback loops for continuous assessment
              of generated code quality, security, and functional correctness.
           * Automated Debugging and Patch Generation: Enabling the system to identify bugs in its own
             generated code and autonomously generate fixes.
           * Root Cause Analysis for Failures: Using AI to determine why a generated application failed and
             what knowledge or process needs refinement.


   7. "Watch" Mechanisms and Event-Driven Ingestion:
       * Challenge: Ingestion is manual. How can the system automatically detect new information or changes in
          its environment and trigger ingestion/refinement?
       * Research Focus:
           * File System Monitoring: Implementing listeners for changes in designated input directories.
           * API/Webhook Integration: Connecting to external systems (e.g., Git repositories, issue trackers)
             to pull new data.
           * Event-Driven Architectures for AI: Designing the system to react to internal and external events,
              triggering specific workflows.


  These topics represent significant research and development areas. Focusing on them will allow the Genesis
   Engine to move beyond its current POC state towards a truly autonomous and self-evolving meta-context
  engineering system.
