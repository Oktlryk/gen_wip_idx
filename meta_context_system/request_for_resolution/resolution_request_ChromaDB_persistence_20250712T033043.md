## Summary
ChromaDB empty after ingestion despite files being moved to ingestion_done

## Error & Stack Trace
```
Although no explicit stack trace was captured for the ChromaDB persistence failure,
the previous ingestion attempt failed with an OSError: [Errno 22] Invalid argument
during embedding generation (in document_interpreter.py). This suggests that
the generated embeddings might have been malformed or caused an issue during
the add_document operation in ChromaDB, leading to data not being persisted.
```

## Code Context
- File: D:/Developer/LLM/proj_context_engineering/test_run_copilot/meta_context_system/meta_context_studio/src/knowledge_base/vector_store.py
- Function/Method: add_document
- Code Snippet:
```python
    def add_document(self, document: ParsedDocument) -> None:
        """
        Adds a ParsedDocument and its content blocks to the vector store.
        Each content block is added as a separate document in ChromaDB.
        """
        for i, block in enumerate(document.content_blocks):
            if block.embedding:
                # Create a unique ID for each content block within the document
                block_id = f"{document.document_id}-{i}"
                self.collection.add(
                    documents=[block.content],
                    metadatas=[{
                        "document_id": document.document_id,
                        "document_type": document.document_type.value,
                        "source_path": document.source_path,
                        "block_type": block.block_type.value,
                        "block_index": i,
                        **block.metadata # Include any existing block metadata
                    }],
                    embeddings=[block.embedding],
                    ids=[block_id]
                )
            else:
                print(f"Warning: Content block {i} in document {document.document_id} has no embedding. Skipping.")
```

## Reproduction Steps
- Command: python D:/Developer/LLM/proj_context_engineering/test_run_copilot/meta_context_studio/scripts/run_ingestion.py
- Input File: All files in ingestion_done were attempted (e.g., The Orchestral Conductors of AI_ A Technical Report on LangGraph vs. Haystack for Meta-Context Engineering.html)
- Intended vs. Actual Behavior: The ingestion pipeline was intended to process documents and persist them in ChromaDB. Files were moved to ingestion_done, but no data was persisted in ChromaDB.
