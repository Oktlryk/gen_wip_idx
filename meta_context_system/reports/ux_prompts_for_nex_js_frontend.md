Of course. After a thorough review of the "Genesis Engine UX Research Plan," it's clear that the primary challenge for the front end is to create a user experience that can translate highly abstract, dynamic, and autonomous AI processes into something comprehensible, controllable, and trustworthy for a human user. The document repeatedly emphasizes the concept of a "Meta-UX"â€”designing for a system that actively creates and refines its own context and knowledge.

A Next.js front end would need to be exceptionally dynamic and capable of sophisticated data visualization to meet these requirements. Based on the core functionalities and UX principles outlined in the report, here are some detailed prompts you could use for Gemini Deep Research to explore the implementation of this front end.

Suggested Research Prompts for Gemini
Here are three detailed prompts you could use to kickstart your research and development for the Genesis Engine's Next.js UI. They are designed to tackle the most unique and challenging aspects described in the UX research plan.

Prompt 1: Architecting the "Living Digital Twin" for Agentic Workflows
"Based on the 'Genesis Engine UX Research Plan,' particularly sections 4.2.1 and 5.1, research and propose a front-end architecture using Next.js for a real-time 'Agentic Workflow Dashboard.'

This dashboard must serve as a 'living digital twin' of the system's operations, visualizing the Meta-Agent's dynamic task decomposition and the hand-offs between specialized agents (e.g., Architect Agent, Test Generation Agent).

Your research should:

Compare and contrast real-time communication strategies for a Next.js application (e.g., WebSockets, Server-Sent Events (SSE), or polling with React Query/SWR) to receive live updates from the Genesis Engine's backend.
Recommend a state management solution (e.g., Zustand, Jotai, or Redux Toolkit) best suited for managing the complex, hierarchical, and rapidly changing state of the agentic workflows.
Evaluate and recommend specific React libraries for creating the interactive, animated flowchart or swimlane visualizations (e.g., React Flow, D3.js, or Mermaid.js). The chosen library must efficiently handle dynamically updating graph structures and support user interactions like 'drilling down' into specific agent tasks and inserting manual HITL steps."
Prompt 2: Designing a High-Performance, Multi-Level Knowledge Graph Explorer
"Investigate and design a component architecture for a high-performance, interactive Knowledge Graph Explorer in a Next.js application, as specified in sections 4.1.2 and 5.2 of the 'Genesis Engine UX Research Plan.'

The visualization must handle large, complex graph structures and support advanced features like 'semantic exploration,' 'abstraction level' toggling, and interactive 'generalization pathways.'

Your investigation should:

Compare WebGL-based libraries (e.g., react-force-graph, sigma.js) against SVG-based libraries (e.g., D3.js) for this use case. Focus on performance with large datasets, rendering speed, and the ability to create highly custom and interactive node/edge representations.
Propose a strategy for implementing the 'abstraction levels' feature, allowing users to fluidly toggle between specific project contexts (concrete nodes) and higher-level generalized patterns (abstract nodes).
Outline a component architecture that integrates this visualization with a natural language query interface (for semantic search) and a dynamic 'information panel' that appears on node selection to display detailed attributes and source provenance."
Prompt 3: Implementing Contextual Explainable AI (XAI) Components
"Drawing from the principles in sections 2.2.3, 4.1.3, and 5.3 of the 'Genesis Engine UX Research Plan,' design and outline the implementation of a suite of Contextual Explainable AI (XAI) components for a Next.js front end.

These components must make the AI's 'deliberation' and 'invisible hand of context' tangible to the user.

Your design should detail the following:

A 'Context Inspector' panel: This component should visualize which context sources were used for a given AI decision, their relevance scores, and how they were weighted. It must also show what information was quarantined to prevent 'context poisoning.'
A 'Reasoning Trace' viewer: This component must visualize the AI's cognitive journey, supporting patterns like Chain-of-Thought (as a step-by-step breakdown) and Tree-of-Thoughts (as an interactive, branching diagram showing explored and discarded paths).
Propose specific React components and data visualization libraries (e.g., Recharts, custom D3 components, or simple HTML/CSS) to create these UIs, including interactive 'explanation sliders' that allow a user to modify input parameters and see how the AI's decision changes in real-time."
These prompts should give you a strong foundation for exploring the technical and architectural decisions needed to build a truly effective and human-centric user experience for the Genesis Engine.
